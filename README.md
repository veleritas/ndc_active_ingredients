Last updated: 2019-04-18

## Background

Commercial drugs in the United States are assigned a unique, three-segment product identifier called the National Drug Code (NDC) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
The three segments of the NDC identify the labeler, the product, and the commercial package size of the drug.
However, it is not clear what the actual active ingredients of a drug are based on the NDC.

## Purpose

To generate a mapping of NDCs to identifiers for the active ingredients.

## Environment Settings
